## Practice: ATM simulation (15 - 20 mins)

- You will write a script to simulate a user interacting with an ATM.
- When you run this in your terminal, you will pass in two arguments: 1) either "withdraw" or "deposit" and 2) an amount of cash.
- In your script, set each of these inputs equal to a variable: $action and $amount
- Set a variable, $total_amount equal to the amount sitting in your bank account, which is 1000 dollars.
- Then, detect if the user is withdrawing or depositing money. If depositing, add the amount deposited to $total_amount and display it to the user: "You have added [amount added] dollars. You have [total] dollars in your bank account now." 
- If withdrawing, subtract the amount withdrawn from the account and display it to the user: "You have withdrawn [amount withdrawn] dollars. You have [remainder] dollars left"
- Finished early? Challenges on next page >>>

#### Challenges: ATM Simulation (continued from previous page)
- <r>Challenge #1</r>: Account for negative input, as people shouldn't be able to withdraw or deposit negatives. If they try to do so, print out an error message. <b>Hint</b>: Google how to exit your script, preventing execution of the rest of the code.
- <r>Challenge #2</r>: Only allow the user to withdraw as much money as they have. If they try to withdraw more, give an error message.
- <r>Challenge #3</r>: Pass in a 3rd and 4th argument via terminal. These arguments will be your pin and credit card combos. In your script, create a dictionary array: $valid_pin_and_card_combos. Put a bunch of pin and credit card combinations inside this array. (Don't use real info.) 
```php
$valid_pin_and_card_combos = array(
      2312 => 22244464432, // add a bunch more
);
```
Then, before you deposit or withdraw cash in your script, write a foreach loop that checks if the pin and username combination exists in your accepted array. If not, throw an error. Only continue if it exists.

# Functions
### A named block of code that can be executed whenever we need it.
### Like a variable, a function needs to be defined before you use it.

---
## Function syntax
```php
function function_name() {
  // code to be executed here
  // the keyword return goes here
}
```

---
## Function syntax
```php
function function_name($argument1) {
  // code to be executed here
  // we now have $argument1 accessible to us
}
```
---

## Function syntax w/ Args
```php
function introduce_person($name) {
  $all_caps_name = strtoupper($name);
  return "I'm $all_caps_name." . PHP_EOL;
}

```

---

## Function syntax w/ Args
```php
function introduce_person($name) {
  $all_caps_name = strtoupper($name);
  return "I'm $all_caps_name." . PHP_EOL;
}

echo hello_world('emily');
```

---

## Function syntax w/ arguments
```php
function introduce_person($name, $year_birth, $year_today) {
  $age = $year_today - $birth_year;
  $all_caps_name = strtoupper($name);
  return "I'm $all_caps_name and $age." . PHP_EOL;
}

echo hello_world('kelly', 1989, 2015);
```
---

## Function syntax w/ arguments
```php
function introduce_person($name, $job) {
  $age = $year - $birth_year;
  $all_caps_name = strtoupper($name);
  return "I'm $all_caps_name and $age years old." . PHP_EOL;
}

// would this work??
echo hello_world('kelly');

```

---

## Practice (20 minutes)

- Write a function called 'average' that takes two numbers as input and returns the average.
- Write a function called 'list_names' that takes our phonebook array as an input and returns a list of all the names.

## Challenge
- Write a function called 'seach_by_letter' that takes two inputs: 1) our phonebook array and 2) a letter of the alphabet. The function returns another phonebook containing only friends whose name starts with that letter.

### Attendance: http://goo.gl/forms/Kr7SN9jHEi
### Warm up (10 mins while people arrive)
- Create a simple list array (without defining your own keys): $my_favorite_colors.
Insert 5 of your top favorite colors. Write a loop that prints out all of your colors.

### Warmup Challenge #1 (see next page if completed last class)
- Create an array containing numbers 1-50. If the number is divisible by 5, print out fizz. If the number if divisible by 3, print out buzz. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print out fizzbuzz.

- <b>HINTS</b>: 1) You probably don't want to type out all numbers 1-100 right? Google your way to a shortcut for creating an array with a range of numbers. 2) Think about the order of execution for your if / else statement.

---

### Warmup Challenge #2:
- Create an array of numbers 1-100. Loop through the array and add up all the even numbers.
- <b>Hint #1</b>: You probably don't want to type out all numbers 1-100 right? Google your way to a shortcut for creating an array with a range of numbers.
- <b>Hint #2</b>: You'll want to set aside a variable that stores your running tally of all the even numbers. Think about where it makes sense to store this variable. Don't be afraid to reach out to a TA for help if you need it!

# Foreach Loops for Dictionary Arrays

```php
$my_pets = array("Spot", "Moomba", "Fluffy");

foreach($my_pets as $pet) {
  echo strtoupper($pet) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

---

```php

$my_pets = array(
  "dog" => "Spot",
  "cat" => "Moomba",
  "hamster" => "Fluffy"
);

// if you have an array with key => value
foreach($my_pets as $pet_type => $name) {
  echo "My $pet_type is named $name." . PHP_EOL;
}
```
---

### Practice (30 mins)
- Create a phone book (or copy and paste from previous class).
- Your keys will be the friend's name. Each of these names should be paired with a value array of their information: phone number, address, and age. Age should be an integer. 
- Example of ONE key-value pair:
```php
  'Emily Xie' => array(
                'phone_number' => '222-222-3333',
                'address' => '111 Happy Street',
                'age' => 25
             ),
  ```
- Loop through the phone book and print out "(Name)'s phone number is: (phone number)" for each element.
- Finished early? Challenges on next page >>

---
### Practice Challenges (for previous page)
- <r>CHALLENGE I</r>: Loop through the array and add up all of the ages of each contact. When you are done looping, print out total age
- <r>CHALLENGE II</r>: Loop through the array and print out phone number, address, and age of all contacts without hard-coding in the keys.
- <r>CHALLENGE III</r>: Add a 'is_favorite' value for each contact. Set the value to true or false depending on whether they are saved as a favorite. Now, loop through and print out the names of your favorites only. Your is_favorite key will look like something below for each contact. But don't just hard-code it in. Programatically push this key to your phone book array.
```php
  'Emily Xie' => array(
                'phone_number' => '222-222-3333',
                'address' => '111 Happy Street',
                'age' => 25,
                'is_favorite' => true,
             ),
```

---

# For Loops

```php
for (init counter; test condition; increment counter) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

---

# For Loops: example

```php
for ($count = 0; $count <= 10; $count++) {
  echo $count . PHP_EOL;
}
```

---

###Practice (10 - 15 minutes)
- Count down from 20 - 1 using a "for" loop.

### Challenge #1
- Print out all of the pet names in the array below using only a "for" loop.
```php
$my_pets_array = array(
      "Fluffy", "Hairball", "Moomba", "Ziggy" 
  );
```

### Challenge #2
- Reverse the string using a "for" loop: 
"I love learning to code." 
- <b>Hint</b>: You can access each character of a string in the same way that you can access elements in an array.

# Passing in user input

---
## Practice: ATM simulation (15 - 20 mins)

- You will write a script to simulate a user interacting with an ATM.
- When you run this in your terminal, you will pass in two arguments: 1) either "withdraw" or "deposit" and 2) an amount of cash.
- In your script, set each of these inputs equal to a variable: $action and $amount
- Set a variable, $total_amount equal to the amount sitting in your bank account, which is 1000 dollars.
- Then, detect if the user is withdrawing or depositing money. If depositing, add the amount deposited to $total_amount and display it to the user: "You have added [amount added] dollars. You have [total] dollars in your bank account now." 
- If withdrawing, subtract the amount withdrawn from the account and display it to the user: "You have withdrawn [amount withdrawn] dollars. You have [remainder] dollars left"
- Finished early? Challenges on next page >>> 

---

#### Challenges: ATM Simulation (continued from previous page)
- <r>Challenge #1</r>: Account for negative input, as people shouldn't be able to withdraw or deposit negatives. If they try to do so, print out an error message. <b>Hint</b>: Google how to exit your script, preventing execution of the rest of the code.
- <r>Challenge #2</r>: Only allow the user to withdraw as much money as they have. If they try to withdraw more, give an error message.
- <r>Challenge #3</r>: Pass in a 3rd and 4th argument via terminal. These arguments will be your pin and credit card combos. In your script, create a dictionary array: $valid_pin_and_card_combos. Put a bunch of pin and credit card combinations inside this array. (Don't use real info.) 
```php
$valid_pin_and_card_combos = array(
      2312 => 22244464432, // add a bunch more
);
```
Then, before you deposit or withdraw cash in your script, write a foreach loop that checks if the pin and username combination exists in your accepted array. If not, throw an error. Only continue if it exists.

# Functions
### A way to save a block of code to be executed at any time
---
## Function syntax
```php
function function_name() {
  // code to be executed here
}
```

---
## Function syntax
```php
function function_name($argument1) {
  // code to be executed here
  // we now have $argument1 accessible to us
}
```
---

## Function syntax w/ Args
```php
function hello_world($name) {
  $upper_case_name = strtoupper($name);
  echo "Hello world! I'm $all_caps_name." . PHP_EOL;
}

```

---

## Function syntax w/ Args
```php
function hello_world($name) {
  $upper_case_name = strtoupper($name);
  echo "Hello world! I'm $all_caps_name." . PHP_EOL;
}

hello_world('emily');
```

---

## Function syntax w/ arguments
```php
function hello_world($name, $job) {
  $all_caps_name = strtoupper($name);
  echo "Hello world! I'm $all_caps_name." . PHP_EOL;
  echo "I'm a $job, but I'm learning to code!" . PHP_EOL;
}

hello_world('kelly', 'lawyer');
```
---

## Function syntax w/ arguments
```php
function hello_world($name, $job) {
  $all_caps_name = strtoupper($name);
  echo "Hello world! I'm $all_caps_name." . PHP_EOL;
  echo "I'm a $job, but I'm learning to code!" . PHP_EOL;
}

// would this work??
hello_world('kelly');

```
---

### Practice (20 minutes)
- Write a function called income_calculator(). It should take three arguments: $name, $hours_worked, $salary_per_hour.
- The function should calculate money that was made in total, saved to a variable.
- When you call the function, it should print to the screen: "[name] made [calculated total amount earned] in the [hours worked] worked."
- Call the function for Wilson, who worked for 8 hours and makes $898.80/hr.
- Call the functon for Henrietta, who worked for 2 hours and makes $5313.32/hr.
- Call the functon for Mildred, who worked for 4 hours and makes $90.32/hr.

### Challenge:
- Account for taxes. Let's assume there's a tax of 30% on every dollar earned for those who make between $500 - $1000 per hour.
- If the earner makes more than $1000 per hour, they will be taxed 50%
- If the earner makes less than $500 per hour, they will be taxed 10%

### Practice: (15 minutes)
- Create a new grocery_calculator() that takes in two arguments: $cost and $amount. The calculator multiplies the cost of an item with the total number. It <b>returns</b> the total cost.
- Use your grocery calculator to detect the cost of 5 apples costing 1 dollar each. Save the result to a variable. 
- Do the same for 4 pineapples costing 2 dollars each and 10 starfruits costing 3 dollars each.
- Add up the total cost of all your groceries and print to the screen: "You owe a total of [total cost] dollars."

### Finished? 
- Congrats! There's no challenge here. The rest of the class should be spent solving programming puzzles in free form. See the rest of the slides. Remember: don't be a stranger. Take advantage of the free mentorship from your TAs!

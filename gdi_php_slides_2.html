### Attendance: http://goo.gl/forms/LorHTSiggo
### Warm up (10 mins while people arrive.)

- Save your name to a variable.
- Write some code to detect if your name is greater than 10 characters long.
- If so, print out: "Hi, [your name]. Nice to meet you. What a long name! Do you have a nickname I could use?"
- Otherwise, print out: "Hi, [your name]. Nice to meet you."

<r>HINT</r>: What sort of control structure did we learn about last class that evaluates a condition down to true or false to determine whether to execute a block of code or not?
<r>HINT</r>: Use Google to see what operation you can perform on a string to count all the letters.

#Arrays
A data type that is used to store a bunch of other data types.

---

## Creating arrays

```php
$my_array = array();

// Or, if you have a newer version of PHP
$my_array = [];
```

---

## An array with elements in it

```php
$my_information = array(
  "Emily",
  "software engineer",
  25
);
```

---

## This is how you output the entire contents of the array to the screen
var_dump($my_information);

---

## This is how you access stuff from an array

```php
// this is the syntax
$my_information[insert index number here];

// for the first item
$my_information[0]

// for the fourth item
$my_information[3]

```
---

## This is how you add to the array

```php
// This is the syntax:
// $my_information[] = put your new item here;

// example of a string
$my_information[] = 'female';

```
---

#Practice (5 - 10 minutes)
- Create an array and store it as $my_phone_book
- Put in the names of 5 of your friends in your phone book.
- Now, retrieve your 4th friend from the phone book and print it out to the screen.
- Now, add another friend into your phone book.
- Now, only print out the name of your newly added friend.
- Dump to the screen your entire array output

---

# Challenge (For previous exercise)
- Create a new variable $search and set it equal to a name of your choice
- If the first name in your phone book is equal to $search, print out 'Match found!'
- Now, check every name in your phone book, and only print out 'Match found!' once at the very end if a match was found.


---


## This is a dictionary array with key value pairs

```php
$my_pets_array = array(
  "dog" => "Fluffy",
  "cat" => "Hairball",
  "parrot" => "Moomba",
  "hamster" => "Ziggy"
);

```
---

####Practice (25 minutes)
- Manipulate your phone book array so that your friends names are now the keys. Each key will be paired to a value array of their information: phone number, address, and age. Age and phone number should be integers.
-  Example of one key-value pair:
```php
  'Emily Xie' => array(
                'phone_number' => '222-222-3333',
                'address' => '111 Happy Street',
                'age' => 25
             ),
  ```
- Access your 2nd friend's phone number and print it to the screen.
- Access your 4th friend's age and print it to the screen.
- Add your 1st and 5th friend's age together and print the result to the screen.
- <r>Push</r> a 6th friend to your list, with phone number, address, and age.

---
# Challenge (For previous exercise)
- Add to each contact array the key 'is_favorite', which can be equal to boolean true or false
- For each contact, set the value of 'is_favorite' to true or false
- If the first name in your phone book is in your favorites (the value of 'is_favorite' is true), print out their name
- Now, check every name in your phone book, and print out only the names of your favorites


---
# Loops
## A way to iterate over an array.
(in other words, to "walk through" each element of an array)

---
```php
$my_pets = array("Spot", "Moomba", "Fluffy");

foreach($my_pets as $pet) {
  echo strtoupper($pet) . PHP_EOL;
}
```
---

## Practice (15mins)
Create a simple array (without defining your own keys): $my_favorite_colors.
Insert 5 of your top favorite colors. Write a loop that prints out all of your colors.

## Challenge:
- Create an array containing numbers 1-50. If the number is divisible by 5, print out fizz. If the number if divisible by 3, print out buzz. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print out fizzbuzz.

- <r>HINTS</r>: 1) You probably don't want to type out all numbers 1-50 right? Google your way to a shortcut for creating an array with a range of numbers. 2) Think about the order of execution for your if / else statement.

---

```php

$my_pets = array(
  "dog" => "Spot",
  "cat" => "Moomba",
  "hamster" => "Fluffy"
);

// if you have an array with key => value mappings
foreach($my_pets as $pet_type => $name) {
  echo "My $pet_type is named $name." . PHP_EOL;
}
```
---

### Practice (30 mins)
- Create a phone book (or copy and paste from previous exercise.).
- Your keys will be the friend's name. Each of these names should be paired with a value array of their information: phone number, address, and age. Age should be an integer. Example key-value pair:
- Loop through the phone book and print out "(Name)'s phone number is: (phone number)" for each element.
- <r>CHALLENGE I</r>: Loop through the array and add up all of the ages of each contact. When you are done looping, print out total age
- <r>CHALLENGE II</r>: Loop through the array and print out phone number, address, and age of all contacts without hard-coding in the keys.
- <r>CHALLENGE III</r>: Add a 'is_favorite' value for each contact. Set the value to true or false. Now, loop through and print out the names of your favorites only.

# If / Else
```php
$name = "Miranda";

if ($name === 'Emily') {
  echo 'Phone number is 222-222-4432';
} elseif ($name === 'Stacey') {
  echo 'Phone number is 111-222-3333';
} elseif ($name === 'Miranda') {
  echo 'Phone number is 333-555-6666';
} elseif ($name === 'Jasmine') {
  echo 'Phone number is 222-333-5555';
} else {
  echo 'Phone number is not available';
}
```



---

# Switch Statements

```php
$name = "Miranda";

switch($name) {
  case 'Emily':
    echo "Phone number is 222-222-4432";
    break;
  case 'Stacey':
    echo 'Phone number is 111-222-3333';
    break;
  case 'Miranda':
   echo 'Phone number is 333-555-6666';
    break;
  case 'Jasmine':
    echo 'Phone number is 222-333-5555';
    break;
  default:
    echo 'Phone number is not available';
}

```

---
### Practice (10 mins): Copy this switch statement. Then run it. Then, try to restructure the code so that it is less repetitive. It should still run the same as before.

```php
$name = "Miranda";

switch($name) {
  case 'Emily':
    echo "Phone number is 222-222-4432";
    break;
  case 'Stacey':
    echo 'Phone number is 111-222-3333';
    break;
  case 'Miranda':
   echo 'Phone number is 333-555-6666';
    break;
  case 'Jasmine':
    echo 'Phone number is 222-333-5555';
    break;
  default:
    echo 'Phone number is not available';
}
```

# Data Types

---

class: center, middle
## string 
## integer
## boolean
## array
## null

---

# Practice (15 mins)
##Strings
- print out 3 strings
- after, convert the last string to all upper case and run your program again

## Integers: 
- print out 342 multiplied by 5
- print out the remainder of 243 divided by 5

---

#Variables

---

# Practice (10 mins)
##Part I
- create two variables: your first name and your last name
- writing only one line of code, print out your full name

##Part II
- create two more integer variables: your birth year and today's year
- writing only one line of code, use these two variables to find out your current age and print it out

#Comparison Operators

---
## >    greater than
## <    less than
## <=   less than or equal to
## >=   greater than or equal to
## ===  equal to
## !==  not equal to

---

class: center, middle
## 9 > 5 * 2;

---


class: center, middle
## 9 <= 9;

---


class: center, middle
## 9 !== 9;

---


class: center, middle
## $variable = (9 !== 9);


---

class: center, middle
# Logical Operators
## &&
## ||


---

class: center, middle
## 9 > 4 && 3 > 1;

---

class: center, middle
## 10 > 3 && 8 > 1000;

---


class: center, middle
## $variable = (10 > 3 || 8 < 1000);

# if/else

---

```php
if ( 10 > 5) {
  echo "Printing first statement";
} else {
  echo "Printing second statement";
}
```

---

```php
if (5 > 9) {

  echo "Printing first statement";

} elseif (10 > 5) {

  echo "Printing second statement";

} else {

  echo "Printing third statement";

}
```
---

```php
if (5 > 9) {

  echo "Printing first statement";

} elseif (10 > 5) {

  echo "Printing second statement";

} else {

  echo "Printing third statement";

}
```
---

# PRACTICE  (20 minutes)

- Write a variable containing your name.
- Write a variable containing your year of birth.
- Write a variable containing today's year.
- Write a variable containing the name of a movie.
- Write an if/else statement checking your age: If your age is 18 or over, then print out "Congrats __(your name)___, you can watch this __(name of movie)__." Otherwise, print out "Sorry, ___(your name)___, you are not old enough to enter". If your age is less than 12, print out: "Where are your parents!??"
- Run your program!
- Then run your program changing your year of birth to 2010. It should print out "Where are your parents!??"
